# Pix2Pix_CFD
An AI model to depict fluid flow.

# About Project
Inspired by https://github.com/loliverhennigh/Steady-State-Flow-With-Neural-Nets , this is a re-implementation on a keras framework with an U-net architecture for the AI model. The training data is borrowed from the shared repository to validate the implementation.

# Training data
training data is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzsbU65NgrSuZDBMOW93OWpsMHM/view?usp=sharing(about 700 MB). Place this file in the directory and edit the notebook accordingly.
